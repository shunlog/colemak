# Colemak variant

From the [official colemak-dh website](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/keyboards.html):

> Colemak-DHk ANSI: This variant, with K in the middle row, was previously recommended for standard ANSI keyboards. New users should adopt the current ANSI recommendation.

The `colemak_ru.xmodmap` map matches the cyrillic letters with the latin ones.
